# word2vec from scratch
Based on https://github.com/OlgaChernytska/word2vec-pytorch
- Updated to avoid deprecated libraries like Torchtext
- Merged into a single file app since it's intended for learning
- Added hugging face datasets for training data
- Improved performance on some CPU tasks
- Removed a lot of redundancy between SkipGrams and CBOW
